## Building

The script is auto-reloadable in the UI.

Exporting is also done in the UI, so there's no build process to manage that I'm aware of.

### Prerequisites

- [Blue Cat Audio Plugin SDK](https://www.bluecataudio.com/Doc/Product_PlugNScript/)


## Background

Way back when, I had an original Boomerang+ Phrase Sampler. Before it was cool; inspired by Trey's use of one.

There really aren't any close emulations of one in plugin-land. So I had to create my own.

The boomerang is a special device because it is, in my opinion, the perfect combination of simple and powerful.

It epitomizes the way of "Perfect is not when there is nothing more to add; rather, it is when there is nothing more to take away."

Every other looper plugin on the market is too complicated.

So to that end i set about to figure out how make a plugin that perfectly emulates the unique layout and behavior of this singular piece of gear.

It's done with love and reverence for the creators and keepers of the original device, and i do intend to reach to them for approval/partnership.
