# Boomerang+ Emulator

VST/AU plugin based on the Boomerang+ Phrase Sampler.

## Building

The script is auto-reloadable in the UI.

Exporting is also done in the UI, so there's no build process to manage that I'm aware of.

### Prerequisites

- [Blue Cat Audio Plugin SDK](https://www.bluecataudio.com/Doc/Product_PlugNScript/)


## Background

Way back when, I had an original Boomerang+ Phrase Sampler. Before it was cool; inspired by Trey's use of one.

There really aren't any close emulations of one in plugin-land. So I had to create my own.

The boomerang is a special device because it is, in my opinion, the perfect combination of simple and powerful.

It epitomizes the way of "Perfect is not when there is nothing more to add; rather, it is when there is nothing more to take away."
