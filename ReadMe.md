# Boomerang+ Emulator

VST/AU plugin based on the Boomerang+ Phrase Sampler.

## Building

The script is auto-reloadable in the UI.

Exporting is also done in the UI, so there's no build process to manage that I'm aware of.

### Prerequisites

- [Blue Cat Audio Plugin SDK](https://www.bluecataudio.com/Doc/Product_PlugNScript/)
